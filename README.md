# 🌍 The Deep Earth

**Deep Earth** is an interactive scroll experience that takes users on a visual and educational journey from the surface of the Earth down into the crust. Inspired by [Neal.fun's Deep Sea](https://neal.fun/deep-sea/), this project reimagines the depths of our planet, revealing fossils, rock layers, excavation artifacts, and geological transitions leading toward the mantle.

## 🚀 Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by [Neal Agarwal's Deep Sea](https://neal.fun/deep-sea/) — a brilliantly simple yet captivating scroll-based experience exploring the ocean's depth. *Deep Earth* flips the concept by diving beneath the surface of the Earth instead of the sea, allowing users to explore underground wonders layer by layer.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** – For strong typing and scalable development
- **React** – Component-based UI framework
- **Framer Motion** – Smooth animations and scroll-based effects
- **SVG** – For detailed and scalable graphics (grass blades, clouds, soil, etc.)
- **CSS/SCSS** – Custom styling for immersive visuals

## 🎨 Features

- Realistic animated grass and cloud layers using SVG and Framer Motion
- Scroll-synced journey through the Earth's crust with immersive transitions
- Interactive discoveries: fossils, minerals, magma pockets, ancient tools
- Depth markers and dramatic section dividers (e.g., crust boundaries)
- Atmospheric elements such as mist and ambient motion for immersion

## 🧠 Learnings

This project deepened my understanding of scroll-based animation, visual storytelling in React, and how to use Framer Motion effectively to drive immersive experiences.
